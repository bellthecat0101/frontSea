  "about": {
    "text": "The members of the Hailiu Ecological Art Studio all have a background in marine biology and experience working in museums. They hope to focus on science, education, and art, and to get closer to people's lives through colorful transparent biological specimens and original marine biological cultural and creative products. Together, we will get to know and respect these good friends who live in the waters around Taiwan, and together we will make the ocean no longer unfamiliar so that everyone will no longer be unfamiliar with the ocean."
